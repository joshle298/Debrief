# Debrief
## :world_map: Overview
DeBrief, is a news insight synthesizer designed to cut the noise out of media consumption. We use LLMs and Embedded Mappings to map media hosted on multiple platforms (Twitter, RSS, Reddit, etc). By monitoring clusters and user preferences, the program summarizes what is relevant and delivers it in succinct terms. This solves the pain point many encounter of constantly scrolling through media to find the portions relevant to readers.

## Opportunity
- As a consumer-facing product: DeBrief crafts a unique media consumption experience for each user, tailoring the influx of news to cater specifically to their preferences. Unlike traditional news platforms that often suffer from topic repetition, DeBrief ensures a diverse and continuously refreshing array of information that aligns with the user's evolving interests (daily). This approach ensures users are exposed only to relevant and varied articles and information, enhancing their overall reading experience and saving them from the monotony of redundancy often prevalent in most news services today.
- Knowledge workers and finance professionals spend hours reading news, much of which is irrelevant. The current information extraction process is expensive and requires immense focus between reading the news and discovering relevant information. These workers have no automated way to cut through the noise and consume such large data. Augmenting knowledge workers’ workflow will increase productivity and ultimately require less labor to complete the same work.
